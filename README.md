## Project Overview
This project aims to change the genre of a movie trailer. Specifically, it focuses on transforming the trailer of the movie "Turno Nocturno."

## Objectives
The goal is to create a trailer that deviates from the original terrorific concept and presents a new beginning for a nurse in her job. 

## Methodology
To achieve this, we employed the following steps:

1. **Audio Separation:** We used the tool Spleeter to separate the audio from the music tracks.
2. **Artificial Intelligence for Audio Generation:** We utilized AI tools to generate new audio tracks.
3. **Voice Tone Adjustment:** The tones of these voices were altered to match those of the original characters.
4. **New Trailer Creation:** The new audio tracks were integrated to produce a trailer with a completely different feel, showcasing a new narrative for the character.

## Tools Used
- **Artificial Intelligence Tools:** For generating and adjusting voice tones.
- **Spleeter:** For separating the audio and music tracks.
